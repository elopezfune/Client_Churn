# Customers Churn

This is a research project on customers churn, which refers to the amount of customers of a given company that stops using products or services during a certain time frame. One can calculate the churn rate by dividing the number of customers lost during that time period -- say monthly -- by the number of existing customers at the beginning of that time period. 
I used the classical Cox Proportional Hazard model to spot the main risks of churning and make individual predictions.
Then I used several Machine Learning models specially adapted to handle right-censored data, to spot the risks factors for churning. 
I built as well two Meta Classifiers using Boosting and Stacking methods to improve the concordance index and make better predictions.
