# Customers Churn

This is a project on Customers Churn, which refers to the amount of customers of a given company that stops using products or services during a certain time frame. One can calculate the churn rate by dividing the number of customers lost during that time period -- say monthly -- by the number of existing customers at the beginning of that time period.

After loading the training data and preprocessing it via the Pipeline, I produced a predictive model using the  Conditional Survival Forest model to spot the main risks of churning and make individual predictions.

The Machine Learning pipeline is stored in the directory "source", where there is a Jupyter notebook with the explanations of the model.
